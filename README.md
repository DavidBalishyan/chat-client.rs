# chat-client.rs
The client for [github.com/DavidBalishyan/chat.rs](https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/chat.rs)
# Project setup
I made a bash script to setup and run the project for you. If you don't have sertain requirements installed, it will automatically install them
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/chat-client.rs.git
cd chat-client.rs
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh <args>
```

"args" is the IP (if **localhost**, then **127.0.0.1**) and the port in this format: **IP:PORT**
